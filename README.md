# nixos-server

Setting up my NixOS home server.

This will be split into two parts. The first one is a regular NixOS image, which is more or less a desktop / needs a keyboard and a monitor.

## Set up the base installation for a server

1. Install NixOS on an SD card and boot up the Raspberry Pi.
2. curl and run the intialization file.
3. Make a "gold" image from the SD card.
